## 🎭 First: Is there more than one Visual Studio Code?

**NOPE.** There is **only one** actual **VS Code app installed on your system** — the Windows one.

That thing you installed from the `.exe` file or the Microsoft Store?

💡 **That’s the only real VS Code binary.**
There’s no separate “Ubuntu” version of VS Code. There’s no secret Linux VS Code hiding in your WSL.

---

## 🔌 So what’s happening with this WSL magic?

When you open VS Code inside WSL — like with:

```bash
code .
```

or if you click on a folder in the **WSL terminal inside Windows Terminal**...

VS Code does this voodoo:

> The **Windows VS Code** app runs as usual...
> But it **installs a tiny "VS Code Server" inside Ubuntu** in the background
> So your editor talks to your Linux file system **remotely through that tunnel**

That’s how it opens `/home/you/project` without freaking out. It’s like VS Code’s Remote WSL plugin becomes a **middleman**.

## 🧠 How to know what’s running when?

| How you open VS Code                           | What’s happening                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You open it from Start Menu                    | Normal Windows VS Code opens — and defaults to last used context                |
| You run `code .` inside WSL                    | Windows VS Code opens in "Remote WSL" mode — connected to Linux                 |
| You click "Open Folder" in VS Code             | Depends — it might reopen the last folder, WSL or Windows, depending on context |
| You see “WSL: Ubuntu” in bottom-left green bar | You’re inside a Remote WSL session (talking to Linux)                           |
| You see nothing or "No Folder Opened"          | You’re in normal Windows mode                                                   |

## 🧪 Test this like a boss:

1. Open VS Code from Start menu
2. Look in the **bottom-left**:

   * If it says **“WSL: Ubuntu”** — it’s running in Remote WSL mode
   * If it says nothing, or your normal Windows path like `C:\Users\You\Projects` — it’s Windows mode
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type:

   ```
   Remote: Close Remote Connection
   ```

   And boom — you’re back to pure Windows VS Code

## 🔍 TL;DR (No cap):

| Thing                                        | Truth                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Do I have two versions of VS Code?”         | ❌ Nope. Only one Windows app                                            |
| “Why does it open WSL even from Start menu?” | It reopens the last session — if you last used WSL, it defaults to that |
| “Is there a separate VS Code on Linux?”      | Nope. Just a small VS Code **server** living in your WSL’s file system  |
| “How do I get back to Windows VS Code?”      | Run `Remote: Close Remote Connection` or open a folder on `C:` drive    |

### 💬 Wanna go full Zen with this?

Create two shortcuts:

* One that opens `code` in Windows mode (`"C:\Users\You\Projects"`)
* One that opens VS Code in WSL directly (by running `code .` inside WSL)

Boom. Control freak mode achieved. 🎛️😎

## 🧠 What’s Happening Right Now (based on what you said):

* ✅ You opened VS Code from the **Start Menu**
* ❗ But it **auto-connected to WSL (Ubuntu)** — you see it in:

  * Bottom-left green label: `WSL: Ubuntu`
  * Python interpreter: `Python (WSL)`
  * Command palette: all WSL mode commands

So even though you didn’t do `code .` — VS Code remembered your **last session** was WSL.
And it just **picked up where you left off.**

🧠 *VS Code is sticky like that — it doesn’t care how you open it. It cares what you opened last.*

## 🤯 So now your question is:

> "How do I switch back to **normal Windows VS Code**, and will doing that screw up my WSL?"

---

### 💥 Answer #1: How to get back to **normal Windows VS Code**

1. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open Command Palette**
2. Type:

   ```
   Remote: Close Remote Connection
   ```
3. Hit Enter ✅

💣 That instantly kicks you out of the WSL tunnel, and now you’re back in regular Windows mode.

You’ll know because:

* Bottom-left will no longer say `WSL: Ubuntu`
* Python interpreter won’t be from Linux
* File paths will look like `C:\Users\You\Something`

---

### 💥 Answer #2: Will this break anything?

**HELL NO.** 🚫

Closing the WSL connection in VS Code:

* ❌ Does NOT shut down your Linux
* ❌ Does NOT uninstall WSL or Ubuntu
* ❌ Does NOT delete files
* ✅ Just stops the *current VS Code window* from being connected to WSL

It’s like unplugging from a cloud server — the server is still there, it’s just idle.

---

### 💥 Answer #3: How to go back **into** WSL mode later?

A few ways:

#### Method 1: From Terminal

```bash
wsl
cd to your project folder
code .
```

This will launch VS Code **and automatically connect to WSL**

#### Method 2: From VS Code Itself

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type:

   ```
   Remote-WSL: New Window
   ```
3. Pick Ubuntu (or your distro)
4. Done 🎯

### 🧙 Summary of Your Powers Now:

| Action                                   | Result                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Open VS Code from Start Menu             | Reopens *last context* (could be WSL or Windows) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P → Close Remote Connection` | Exit WSL mode and go back to local Windows files |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P → Remote-WSL: New Window`  | Launches VS Code inside Ubuntu WSL again         |
| `code .` from Ubuntu terminal            | Same thing — launches VS Code inside WSL         |

---

### 💡 BONUS TIP: Force it to always open local by default

You can edit VS Code settings so it **doesn't auto-connect to WSL** every time you launch.

1. Open VS Code → Press `Ctrl + ,`
2. Search for:

   ```
   remote.autoConnect
   ```
3. Set it to `false`

Boom. No more surprise WSL sessions.
You’re in full control now, boss 👑
