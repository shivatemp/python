ok so just refreshing our plan:
---

# 🧠 OVERALL OBJECTIVE:

> 🎯 **Set up a professional, WSL-powered Python + Git + VS Code environment on a clean Windows 11 system with robust GitHub integration using SSH over port 443 — ready for cloud/DevOps learning and development.**

---

# ✅ PHASE 1: Install Core Tools on Windows

### 🎯 Objective:

> Get all essential developer tools installed on your Windows 11 machine — the stuff needed before we go into the Linux side (WSL).

### 📋 Checklist:

* [ ] Install **Windows Terminal** from Microsoft Store
  → We’ll use this instead of boring old CMD/PowerShell
* [ ] Install **VS Code**
  → Check “Add to PATH” and context menu options during install
* [ ] Install **Python for Windows**
  → Just for VS Code to behave; WSL will get its own Python
  → MUST check “Add Python to PATH”
* [ ] Install **Git for Windows**
  → Choose VS Code as editor
  → Select “Git from command line and 3rd-party software”
* [ ] Install **WSL + Ubuntu**
  → Run `wsl --install` in PowerShell (Admin)
  → Restart after install, then complete Ubuntu setup (username + password)
* [ ] Install these VS Code Extensions:

  * [ ] Python (by Microsoft)
  * [ ] Remote - WSL
  * [ ] GitLens
  * [ ] GitHub Pull Requests & Issues

### ✅ Completion Test:

* [ ] You can open **Ubuntu via Windows Terminal**
* [ ] You can run `code .` inside Ubuntu and it opens VS Code
* [ ] `python --version` and `git --version` both work in CMD and in Ubuntu

---

# ✅ PHASE 2: Set Up WSL Dev Environment (Linux side)

### 🎯 Objective:

> Make WSL (Ubuntu) your primary dev environment — install Python, Git, generate SSH keys, and configure GitHub access over port 443.

### 📋 Checklist:

* [ ] Open Ubuntu (WSL) from Windows Terminal

* [ ] Run full system update:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```

* [ ] Install **Python + pip** inside WSL:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
  ```

* [ ] Install **Git** inside WSL:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install git -y
  ```

* [ ] Set global Git config:

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  ```

* [ ] Generate SSH key:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
  ```

  * Just press Enter through all prompts

* [ ] Create or edit SSH config:

  ```bash
  nano ~/.ssh/config
  ```

  Paste this in:

  ```
  Host github.com
    Hostname ssh.github.com
    Port 443
    User git
  ```

  Save & close (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`)

* [ ] Copy SSH public key:

  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  ```

* [ ] Add it to GitHub:
  → GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key
  → Paste the key, give it a name (e.g. “WSL Ubuntu Key”)

* [ ] Test SSH connection:

  ```bash
  ssh -T git@github.com
  ```

  → You should see: **“Hi your-username! You’ve successfully authenticated…”**

# ✅ PHASE 3: GitHub + VS Code Dev Workflow

### 🎯 Objective:

> Use VS Code + WSL to build and push Python projects using Git and GitHub, with clean file management and proper workflows.

### 📋 Checklist:

* [ ] Open VS Code with **Remote - WSL** (Command Palette → "Remote-WSL: New Window")
* [ ] Inside VS Code terminal (in WSL), navigate to your dev folder:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  mkdir projects
  cd projects
  ```
* [ ] Create a new Python project:

  ```bash
  mkdir my-first-python
  cd my-first-python
  touch main.py
  ```
* [ ] Initialize Git:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```
* [ ] Create a README and commit:

  ```bash
  touch README.md
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```
* [ ] Create an empty repo on GitHub (don’t initialize with README)
* [ ] Add GitHub remote:

  ```bash
  git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo-name.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```
* [ ] Confirm project appears on GitHub

---

## 🏁 ONCE ALL 3 PHASES ARE COMPLETE:

🎉 You now have:

* A full Linux dev environment
* Clean Python + Git + VS Code setup
* Reliable SSH-based GitHub access (that works even on locked-down Wi-Fi)
* A workflow that mirrors **how real developers and cloud engineers work**

From here, you’re ready to:

* Start building Python projects
* Learn AWS CLI, Docker, Terraform, etc.
* Conquer the DevOps world one commit at a time 🚀
