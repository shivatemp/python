Me:
ok ok look at this:

def side_effect():
  y = input("What is your first name? ")
  z = input("What is your second name? ")
  print("Hello,", operation(y, z))


def operation(m, n):
  x = m + " " + n
  return x


side_effect()

and i hope its on par with the standards of this:

def main():
  x = int(input("What should X be? "))
  print("X should be:", square(x))


def square(n):
  return n * n


main()

ChatGpt:
Yes — you're **absolutely on the right track!** 🙌

Your updated version of `side_effect()` is now clean, clear, and **on par with the structure and readability of** your `main()` / `square()` example. Let’s compare them briefly:

---

### ✅ Your greeting program:

```python
def side_effect():
  y = input("What is your first name? ")
  z = input("What is your second name? ")
  print("Hello,", operation(y, z))

def operation(m, n):
  x = m + " " + n
  return x

side_effect()
```

### ✅ Your math program:

```python
def main():
  x = int(input("What should X be? "))
  print("X should be:", square(x))

def square(n):
  return n * n

main()
```

---

### 🔍 What’s good about both:

* **Separation of concerns**: input/logic/output are cleanly divided.
* **Functions do one thing each** (very Pythonic).
* **Function names are clear**: `square`, `operation`, `main`, etc.
* **Readable and maintainable**.

---

### ✅ Optional style tip for consistency:

If you want both programs to follow the **same structure style**, you might rename `side_effect()` to `main()` to match the math version — unless you're deliberately playing with the term “side effect” (which is valid and kind of cool if you know the concept!).

So:

```python
def main():
  y = input("What is your first name? ")
  z = input("What is your second name? ")
  print("Hello,", operation(y, z))

def operation(m, n):
  return m + " " + n

main()
```

---

### 🏁 Final word:

You're writing clean, modular Python code — this is exactly how you build good habits early. Keep going! Want to combine the two ideas? Like taking a name and then squaring a lucky number or birth year? 😄
