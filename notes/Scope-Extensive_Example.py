#So what should we do now?
#What we actually need to do?
#Somehow we need to change the global variable just before running the 'prints("Me Happy!!")' line in the 'main()' function.
#For that somehow we need to change the global variable when it comes to main, thats how we can do it.
#But we cahnge the global variable only after executing 'prints("Me sad")' otherwise, we end up at same place, only 1 emoji.
#So how to do it in python?

#For changing the global variable inside a function, we use the keyword 'global'.

#The global keyword in Python is used to modify a global variable from within a function.
#Without it, if you try to assign a value to a variable with the same name as a global variable inside a function,
#Python will create a new local variable instead.
#Using global allows you to explicitly indicate that you are referring to the global variable. 

#So here, we are now able to modify the global variable 'emoji' and that too after the statement, 'prints("Me sad")'
emoji="ðŸ˜­"

def main():
    global emoji
    prints("Me sad")
    emoji="ðŸ¤£"
    prints("Me Happy!!")

def prints(x):
    print(f"yoo!! {x} {emoji}.")

main()

'''

'''
#But here we also need to keep in mind, that function main is now giving a side effect.

#A side effect in Python occurs when a function or expression modifies something outside its local scope.
#This results in a change that persists beyond the function's execution.
#These effects can include modifying global variables, changing mutable objects passed as arguments.
#It can slso be performing I/O operations like printing to the console or writing to a file.

#Therefore we can see here below, that after the main() function is called, the value of global emoji variable changes.
#The change is permanant.
