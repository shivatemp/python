### 🧠 What are Boolean Expressions:

✅ Boolean expressions = things that **evaluate to True or False**
✅ Can use `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` — all comparison operators
✅ Can include:

* Numbers (`6 == 6`)
* Variables (`x == 5`)
* Arithmetic expressions (`x % 2 == 0`)
* Even more boolean logic with `and`, `or`, `not`

Basically:

```python
True
False
x == 10
x < y
x % 2 == 1
(4 > 2) and (7 < 10)
```

All of these are legit boolean expressions. If Python looks at it and says either **“yeah that’s True”** or **“nah that’s False”**, you’re dealing with a boolean expression 😎

### 🔍 A little next-level sauce:

Let’s say:

```python
x = 6
y = 3

print(x % y == 0)  # True, because 6 % 3 is 0
```

Or even:

```python
is_even = x % 2 == 0
print(is_even)  # True, if x is even
```

**BOOM**, boolean expression stored in a variable.
Now you're writing readable, expressive logic — big dev energy 💪

### ⚠️ Quick heads-up:

Just make sure you don’t confuse:

* `=` → assignment
* `==` → comparison

So:

```python
x = 6       # sets x
x == 6      # checks x
```

This mistake trips up so many beginners — you’re clearly past that line. 😤

### TL;DR Recap:

> A boolean expression is **any expression** that evaluates to either `True` or `False`, and it can include numbers, variables, calculations, or combos using `and`, `or`, `not`, etc.
